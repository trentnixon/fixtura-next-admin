# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Scheduler Management

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Main schedulers page with rollup data and comprehensive overview
- [x] Individual scheduler detail pages with render tables
- [x] Today's and tomorrow's scheduler components with tabbed navigation
- [x] Scheduler bar chart component for data visualization by days
- [x] Scheduler rendering table for detailed render information
- [x] Scheduler rollup data component for statistics and metrics
- [x] Dynamic routing with [schedulersID] parameter
- [x] Integration with custom hooks for scheduler data fetching
- [x] Real-time data updates for current scheduling status

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Page Enhancement**

   - Add comprehensive error handling and loading states
   - Implement data validation and form validation
   - Add bulk operations for scheduler management
   - Create advanced filtering and search capabilities

2. **User Experience Improvements**

   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common scheduler actions
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for schedule management
   - Create customizable scheduler dashboard layouts
   - Add real-time notifications for schedule changes

3. **Data Visualization**

   - Enhance chart components with more chart types (line, pie, area)
   - Add interactive data exploration features
   - Implement data export functionality (CSV, PDF, Excel)
   - Create advanced analytics and reporting for scheduler performance

4. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement virtual scrolling for large scheduler data sets
   - Add data caching and memoization for scheduler information
   - Optimize page loading and rendering performance
   - Create lazy loading for heavy scheduler components

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Add real-time data synchronization for scheduler updates
   - Implement offline support with local caching
   - Create advanced scheduler configuration and automation
   - Add audit logging and activity tracking for scheduler operations

## üí° Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Standardize scheduler component APIs and prop patterns
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for all scheduler functionality
- **Documentation**: Create scheduler management guides and admin documentation
- **Performance**: Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all scheduler pages meet WCAG compliance standards
- **Internationalization**: Add i18n support for all scheduler-related text
- **Security**: Implement proper data validation and security measures
- **Mobile Experience**: Optimize all scheduler pages for mobile and tablet devices
- **Code Organization**: Refactor complex scheduler components into smaller, reusable pieces
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strong TypeScript integration throughout
