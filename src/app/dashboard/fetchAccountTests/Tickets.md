## üåü Ticket Structure

Every ticket must include the following sections:

1. **Metadata Block**

   ```md
   ---
   ID: TKT-YYYY-NNN
   Status: Draft | In Progress | Completed
   Priority: High | Medium | Low
   Owner: (Name / Team)
   Created: YYYY-MM-DD
   Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   Related: Roadmap-[ID], Epic-[ID], Dependency-[ID]
   ---
   ```

2. **Overview**
   A short description of the ticket's purpose.

3. **What We Need to Do**
   A high-level statement of the goal.

4. **Phases & Tasks** _(only for new or in-progress tickets)_

   - Organise work into phases.
   - Each phase contains a **Tasks** list.
   - Tasks must use checkbox format `[ ]` and start with an **action verb**.

   Example:

   ```md
   ### Phase 1: Setup Infrastructure

   #### Tasks

   - [ ] Research caching options (Redis vs in-memory)
   - [ ] Add caching dependency to project
   - [ ] Configure cache service wrapper
   ```

5. **Constraints, Risks, Assumptions**
   Capture anything that may affect the ticket.
   Example:

   - Constraints: Waiting on Redis env vars.
   - Risks: Cache invalidation complexity.
   - Assumptions: Traffic patterns are stable.

### Overview

Create TypeScript types for account scrape tests functionality.

### What We Need to Do

Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for account-specific scrape test data, extending the existing fetch-test types with account-specific fields and relationships.

### Phases & Tasks

#### Phase 1: Type Definition

- [ ] Create account-specific test run interfaces
- [ ] Define account test summary and metrics types
- [ ] Add account relationship types to existing interfaces
- [ ] Create account test charts and visualization types

#### Phase 2: Integration

- [ ] Update existing fetch-test types to support account filtering
- [ ] Ensure type compatibility with existing API endpoints
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript exports and imports

### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- Constraints: Must maintain compatibility with existing fetch-test types
- Risks: Type complexity may increase with account-specific data
- Assumptions: Account data structure is similar to existing test data

### Overview

Create API service functions for fetchAccountTests following established patterns.

### What We Need to Do

Implement server-side API functions that fetch account-specific scrape test data, following the same patterns as the existing fetchTests services.

### Phases & Tasks

#### Phase 1: Service Implementation

- [ ] Create fetchAllAccountTests service function
- [ ] Create fetchAccountTestById service function
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Add TypeScript type safety

#### Phase 2: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test API endpoints with mock data
- [ ] Validate error handling scenarios
- [ ] Ensure proper response formatting

### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- Constraints: Must follow existing axios instance patterns
- Risks: API endpoint availability and response structure
- Assumptions: Backend endpoints will follow similar patterns to fetchTests

### Overview

Create React Query hooks for fetchAccountTests data fetching.

### What We Need to Do

Implement custom hooks using Tanstack Query for fetching account test data, following the established patterns from fetchTests hooks.

### Phases & Tasks

#### Phase 1: Hook Implementation

- [x] Create useFetchAccountTestsQuery hook
- [x] Create useFetchAccountTestByIdQuery hook
- [x] Implement proper query key strategies
- [x] Add enabled conditions for conditional fetching

#### Phase 2: Integration

- [x] Test hooks with existing components
- [x] Ensure proper caching behavior
- [x] Add error handling and loading states

### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- Constraints: Must use existing Tanstack Query configuration
- Risks: Query cache conflicts with existing fetchTests data
- Assumptions: React Query patterns are consistent across the application
