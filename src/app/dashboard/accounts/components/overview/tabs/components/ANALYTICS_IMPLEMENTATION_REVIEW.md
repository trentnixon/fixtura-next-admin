# Account Analytics Implementation Review

**Date:** December 2024
**Component:** Single Account Analytics Display
**Location:** `/dashboard/accounts/club/[id]` and `/dashboard/accounts/association/[id]`

---

## What We Built

### Overview

Implemented account-specific analytics for individual clubs and associations, focusing on financial performance, subscription status, order history, and trial information.

### Components Implemented

1. **FinancialOverview**

   - Displays: Total Season Revenue, Season Pass Value, Renewal Status, Last Season Pass
   - Key Metrics: Lifetime value, current season rate, payment status
   - Styled with: `shadow-none bg-slate-50 border-b-4 border-b-slate-500`

2. **SubscriptionStatusCard**

   - Displays: Current season pass details (dates, tier, status)
   - Shows: Days remaining, renewal status
   - Simplified to show ONLY the most recent/active season pass (not historical data)

3. **OrderHistoryTable**

   - Displays: Complete order history with sortable/filterable table
   - Features: Order IDs link to Strapi CMS admin panel
   - Summary: Filtered orders, average order value, total displayed revenue
   - Date formatting: Uses `formatDate()` for readable dates (October 24, 2025)

4. **TrialPerformancePanel**

   - Displays: Free trial status, activation/completion dates, duration
   - Shows: Trial conversion status
   - Focus: Single free trial per account (simplified from multiple trials)

5. **TrialHistory**
   - Displays: Detailed trial information in table format
   - Shows: Start/end dates, duration, tier, conversion status
   - Summary stats: Total trials, converted trials, conversion rate

### What Was Removed

- Account Health Dashboard (not relevant to season-based model)
- Risk Assessment (not relevant to annual subscriptions)
- Usage Patterns component (not applicable to cricket clubs)
- Order Frequency & Revenue Trend Charts (replaced with yearly data)
- Account Timeline (redundant)

---

## What Fixtura Needs

### Business Model Context

- **Season-Based:** Cricket runs on annual seasons (6-month periods)
- **Annual Payments:** Customers buy "Season Passes" (not monthly subscriptions)
- **Single Free Trial:** Each account gets one trial before purchasing
- **Simple Lifecycle:** Trial → Season Pass → Renewal → Season Pass

### Key Data Requirements

#### 1. Financial Information

- Total lifetime revenue (all seasons combined)
- Current season pass value (annual rate)
- Last season pass purchase date
- Payment success rate
- Total number of seasons subscribed

#### 2. Subscription Status

- Current season pass status (Active/Inactive)
- Season pass tier (if applicable)
- Start and end dates of current season
- Days remaining in season
- Auto-renewal status (not applicable, removed)

#### 3. Order History

- Complete order history with dates, amounts, status
- Order IDs linked to Strapi CMS
- Payment methods
- Tier information

#### 4. Trial Information

- Whether trial has been activated
- Trial start/end dates
- Trial duration
- Conversion status (did they convert to paid?)

### What We DON'T Need

- Monthly recurring revenue trends
- Customer lifetime value projections
- Churn analysis (cricket clubs renew annually)
- Usage patterns (not applicable)
- Health scores/risk factors
- Cohort analysis
- Subscription renewal rates (there's only one renewal per season)

## Lessons Learned for Main Analytics Component

### 1. Data Structure Alignment

- **Issue:** API returns data in cents, need to divide by 100 for display
- **Solution:** Applied `/100` conversion consistently across all financial displays
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should handle currency conversion at the service layer

### 2. Seasonal vs. Monthly Thinking

- **Issue:** Initially displayed monthly trends (not relevant for annual subscriptions)
- **Solution:** Changed to yearly aggregation and seasonal terminology
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should group by cricket season, not calendar month

### 3. Simplification is Key

- **Issue:** Tried to implement SaaS-style metrics (health scores, risk factors)
- **Solution:** Removed irrelevant metrics, focused on cricket-specific data
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should only show metrics relevant to sports management

### 4. Trial Conversion Logic

- **Issue:** Trial conversion detection was incorrect
- **Solution:** Check if paid Season Pass exists AFTER trial date
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should track trial-to-paid conversion at subscription level

### 5. Date Formatting

- **Issue:** Displaying dates as 24/10/2025 was not readable
- **Solution:** Use `formatDate()` utility for full dates (October 24, 2025)
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should use consistent date formatting

### 6. UI Consistency

- **Issue:** Components had inconsistent styling
- **Solution:** Standardized on `shadow-none bg-slate-50 border-b-4 border-b-slate-500 rounded-md`
- **Apply to:** Main analytics should follow the same styling patterns

## Recommendations for Main Account Analytics

### Metrics to Include

1. **Total Season Passes Sold** (count)
2. **Total Revenue** (dollars, not cents)
3. **Average Season Pass Value** (annual rate)
4. **Conversion Rate** (from trial to paid)
5. **Active Accounts** (with current season pass)
6. **Revenue by Season** (group by cricket year)
7. **Accounts by Sport** (cricket, netball, etc.)
8. **Season Pass Renewal Rate** (year-over-year)

### Metrics to Exclude

1. Monthly recurring revenue (not applicable)
2. Churn analysis (too complex for annual subscriptions)
3. Customer cohorts (not relevant)
4. Usage engagement scores (not applicable)
5. Risk assessments (not relevant)
6. Health scores (not applicable)

### Data Aggregation

- **Group by:** Cricket season/year, not calendar month
- **Time period:** Yearly trends, not monthly
- **Revenue:** Total annual revenue, not MRR
- **Subscriptions:** Season passes, not monthly subscriptions

### UI Patterns

- Use consistent card styling: `shadow-none bg-slate-50 border-b-4 border-b-slate-500`
- Use emerald color scheme for icons: `text-emerald-500`
- Format dates with `formatDate()` utility
- Convert currency from cents to dollars at display layer
- Keep charts simple and cricket-focused
