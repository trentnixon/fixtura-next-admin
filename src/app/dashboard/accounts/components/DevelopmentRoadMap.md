# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Account Components

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] AccountOverview component with metrics and summary data
- [x] AccountBasics component for basic account information display
- [x] Action components for account operations (delete, sync, navigation)
- [x] Tab-based organization for complex account information
- [x] Metric card components for key performance indicators
- [x] Scheduler, sponsors, and subscription tier components
- [x] Template and theme information components
- [x] Trial instance management components
- [x] Chart components for data visualization
- [x] UI components for account titles and sync CTAs

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Component Enhancement**

   - Add loading states and skeleton components for all data components
   - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Add data validation and form validation
   - Create bulk action components for multiple account operations

2. **User Experience Improvements**

   - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for account organization
   - Create customizable dashboard layouts
   - Add real-time notifications and updates

3. **Data Visualization**

   - Enhance chart components with more chart types
   - Add interactive data exploration features
   - Implement data export functionality (CSV, PDF, Excel)
   - Create advanced analytics and reporting

4. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement component lazy loading and code splitting
   - Add memoization for expensive components
   - Optimize data fetching and caching
   - Create virtual scrolling for large data sets

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Add real-time data synchronization
   - Implement offline support with local caching
   - Create advanced user permissions and role management
   - Add audit logging and activity tracking

## üí° Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Standardize component APIs and prop patterns across all account components
- **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for all account functionality
- **Documentation**: Create component documentation and usage examples
- **Performance**: Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG compliance standards
- **Internationalization**: Add i18n support for all user-facing text
- **Security**: Implement proper data validation and security measures
- **Mobile Experience**: Optimize all components for mobile and tablet devices
- **Code Organization**: Refactor complex components into smaller, reusable pieces
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strong TypeScript integration throughout
