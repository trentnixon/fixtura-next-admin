# Data Visualization Strategy: Render Analytics

This document outlines the charting and analytical visualizations required for the Global Render Monitor to track system load, asset production, and account distribution.

## 1. System Throughput (Timeline)
**Goal**: Visualize the volume of rendering activity over time.
- **Render Volume by Week/Month**: A stacked area chart showing the total number of renders.
- **Breakdown by Org Type**: Use different colors in the stack to differentiate between **Club** and **Association** renders.
- **Trend Analysis**: Overlay a trend line to show growth or seasonal peaks (e.g., season start/finals).

## 2. Asset Production & Efficiency
**Goal**: Track the "Productivity" of the system.
- **Average Assets per Render**: A multi-line chart tracking:
    - Avg Video Assets
    - Avg Image Assets
    - Avg AI Articles
- **Asset Type Distribution**: A pie or donut chart showing the global mix of output (e.g., "60% Videos, 30% Images, 10% AI").
- **Monthly Asset Load**: A bar chart showing the total number of assets created per month to track storage and compute costs.

## 3. Account & Organization Analytics
**Goal**: Identify the heavy hitters and usage patterns.
- **Large Accounts by Asset Type**: A horizontal bar chart showing the Top 10 accounts based on asset volume, grouped by asset type.
- **Sector Growth**: Comparison of total assets generated by Clubs vs. Associations.

## 4. Load & Performance
**Goal**: Monitor system stress.
- **Processing Time Heatmap**: A calendar or heatmap showing the average render duration by hour of the day/day of the week. This identifies "Rush Hour" bottlenecks.
- **Asset Creation Latency**: Tracking how long it takes from `publishedAt` to the final `Download` object being attached.

## Technical Implementation (Recharts)
- **Colors**:
    - Video: `brandPrimary` (Indigo)
    - Image: `brandSecondary` (Teal)
    - AI: `brandAccent` (Amber)
- **Interactivity**: All charts must support Tooltips that show absolute values and "Click to Filter" functionality (e.g., clicking the "Club" section in a chart filters the `GlobalRenderTable`).

## API Requirements for Analytics
To support these visualizations without killing performance, we need:
1. **Aggregated Analytics Endpoint**: `/api/renders/analytics` (Proposed)
    - Should return pre-computed buckets by month/week.
2. **Account Summary Endpoint**: `/api/accounts/rendering-leaders`
    - Should return accounts with the highest asset counts across their history.
