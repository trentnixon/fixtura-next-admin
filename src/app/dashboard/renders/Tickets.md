## Overview

Align the render overview component styling with the established dashboard design patterns using consistent Card components, color schemes, and layout structures.

## What We Need to Do

Update the render overview component (`renderOverview.tsx`) to use the same styling patterns found throughout the dashboard, specifically:

- Replace custom border/div styling with standardized Card components
- Apply consistent color schemes and border-bottom accent colors
- Use proper CardHeader, CardTitle, and CardContent structure
- Implement consistent spacing and typography
- Add appropriate icons for visual consistency

## Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Research and Analysis

- [x] Research existing dashboard styling patterns
- [x] Identify key Card component usage patterns
- [x] Document current styling inconsistencies in renderOverview.tsx

### Phase 2: Component Structure Update

- [x] Replace custom div/border styling with Card components
- [x] Implement proper CardHeader, CardTitle, and CardContent structure
- [x] Add consistent Card className patterns (bg-slate-50, border-b-4, etc.)
- [x] Update scheduler information section styling

### Phase 3: Visual Consistency

- [x] Add appropriate icons for each metric (Calendar, Clock, Database, etc.)
- [x] Apply consistent color schemes for border-bottom accents
- [x] Implement proper spacing and typography alignment
- [x] Ensure responsive grid layout consistency

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

- [x] Test component rendering across different screen sizes
- [x] Validate styling consistency with other dashboard components
- [x] Ensure accessibility and usability standards are maintained

## Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

### Constraints

- Must maintain existing functionality and data display
- Should not break existing component interfaces
- Limited to available icon set (Lucide React)

### Risks

- Potential layout shifts during styling updates
- Possible impact on responsive behavior
- Need to ensure data formatting remains intact

### Assumptions

- Existing Card component library is sufficient for all styling needs
- Current data structure and props don't need modification
- User experience should remain consistent with other dashboard sections

## Notes

- Current render overview uses basic div/border styling that doesn't match dashboard patterns
- Other dashboard components use Card components with bg-slate-50, border-b-4, and consistent color schemes
- Need to maintain the grid layout structure while updating individual card styling
- Icons should be contextually appropriate (Calendar for dates, Database for counts, etc.)
