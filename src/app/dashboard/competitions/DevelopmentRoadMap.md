# Development Roadmap – Competitions Dashboard

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Confirm page scaffolding and shared UI needs for the competitions dashboard (see TKT-2025-010)
- [x] Implement admin stats data flow, hook, and UI integration (see TKT-2025-010)

## ⏳ To Do (easy → hard)

1. [ ] Expand dashboard with comparative analytics and drilldowns once stats baseline is stable (see TKT-2025-011)

## 💡 Recommendations

- Coordinate with backend on any optional filters or pagination extensions before scaling charts (link planned to TKT-2025-011)
- Reuse existing loading/error UI primitives from accounts dashboards for consistency
- Consider extracting reusable KPI and chart widgets after first implementation to share across admin dashboards
