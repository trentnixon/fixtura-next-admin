# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Types System

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Core type definitions for all major entities (Account, Competition, Render, Team, etc.)
- [x] Strapi CMS integration patterns with id/attributes structure
- [x] State management types for React components
- [x] Game data types for multiple sports (AFL, Basketball, Hockey, Netball)
- [x] Centralized export system through index.ts
- [x] Cross-referencing between related types (Account ‚Üí Order, Competition ‚Üí Grade, etc.)

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Type Safety Improvements**

   - Replace `any` types with proper type definitions (especially in AccountAttributes.scheduler)
   - Add strict null checks and optional property handling
   - Implement discriminated unions for status fields

2. **Documentation Enhancement**

   - Add JSDoc comments to all interfaces and types
   - Create type usage examples for complex interfaces
   - Document the relationship patterns between entities

3. **Type Organization**

   - Group related types into subfolders (e.g., game/, account/, render/)
   - Create shared utility types (e.g., BaseEntity, Timestamps, Pagination)
   - Implement generic types for common patterns

4. **API Integration Types**

   - Add comprehensive API response types
   - Create error handling types
   - Implement pagination and filtering types

5. **Advanced Type Features**
   - Add branded types for IDs to prevent mixing different entity IDs
   - Implement conditional types for complex business logic
   - Create type guards and validation schemas

## üí° Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Standardize naming conventions across all type files (some use camelCase, others PascalCase)
- **Performance**: Consider using `type` instead of `interface` for simple data structures
- **Validation**: Integrate with runtime validation libraries (Zod, Yup) for type safety at runtime
- **Testing**: Add type tests to ensure interfaces remain compatible during refactoring
- **Migration**: Plan gradual migration from `any` types to specific types to avoid breaking changes
- **Tooling**: Set up TypeScript strict mode and enable additional compiler checks
- **Documentation**: Create a types guide for developers explaining the data model relationships
