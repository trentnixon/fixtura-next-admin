# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Component Library

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Comprehensive UI component library built on Radix UI primitives
- [x] Business logic components for charts, tables, and data visualization
- [x] Provider components for global state and React Query integration
- [x] Layout and scaffolding components for consistent page structure
- [x] Typography components with consistent styling hierarchy
- [x] TypeScript integration with proper prop interfaces and type safety
- [x] Tailwind CSS styling with custom utility functions
- [x] Component variant management using class-variance-authority
- [x] Authentication integration with Clerk components

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Component Documentation**

   - Add Storybook stories for all components
   - Create comprehensive JSDoc documentation
   - Add usage examples and code snippets
   - Implement component testing with visual regression tests

2. **Component Enhancement**

   - Add more chart types (line, pie, area charts)
   - Implement advanced table features (sorting, pagination, column resizing)
   - Create form components with validation integration
   - Add loading states and skeleton components for all data components

3. **Accessibility Improvements**

   - Audit all components for WCAG compliance
   - Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
   - Implement focus management and screen reader support
   - Create accessibility testing utilities

4. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement component lazy loading and code splitting
   - Add memoization for expensive components
   - Optimize bundle size with tree shaking
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Create component composition patterns and HOCs
   - Implement theme system with dark/light mode support
   - Add internationalization support for all text content
   - Create component generator CLI for rapid development

## üí° Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Standardize component naming conventions and prop patterns
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and visual tests
- **Documentation**: Create interactive component documentation with live examples
- **Performance**: Implement performance monitoring and optimization strategies
- **Developer Experience**: Create component development tools and debugging utilities
- **Design System**: Establish design tokens and component design guidelines
- **Accessibility**: Make accessibility a first-class citizen in component development
- **Internationalization**: Add i18n support for all user-facing text
- **Theming**: Implement comprehensive theming system with CSS variables
- **Component Library**: Consider publishing as standalone npm package for reuse
