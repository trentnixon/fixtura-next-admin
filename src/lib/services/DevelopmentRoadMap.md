# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Services Layer

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Core service functions for all major entities (accounts, competitions, renders, teams, etc.)
- [x] Consistent error handling patterns with AxiosError differentiation
- [x] TypeScript integration with proper type definitions
- [x] Strapi CMS integration using qs library for query serialization
- [x] Server Actions implementation for Next.js compatibility
- [x] Domain-based organization (accounts/, competitions/, renders/, etc.)
- [x] CRUD operations for most entities (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [x] Detailed error logging with request/response information

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Error Handling Standardization**

   - Create centralized error handling utility
   - Standardize error response formats across all services
   - Add retry logic for transient failures
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

2. **Type Safety Improvements**

   - Replace remaining `any` types with proper interfaces
   - Add request/response validation schemas
   - Implement generic service base class for common patterns
   - Add runtime type checking for API responses

3. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement request caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add request deduplication for identical concurrent calls
   - Optimize query parameters and population strategies
   - Add request/response compression

4. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Add unit tests for all service functions
   - Implement integration tests with mock API responses
   - Add error scenario testing
   - Create service testing utilities and mocks

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement request/response interceptors for logging and monitoring
   - Add API rate limiting and throttling
   - Create service health checks and monitoring
   - Implement offline support with local caching

## üí° Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Standardize function naming conventions (some use `fetch`, others use `get`)
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to all service functions with parameter descriptions
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategy based on data freshness requirements
- **Monitoring**: Add performance metrics and API call tracking
- **Security**: Implement request signing and API key rotation
- **Scalability**: Consider implementing service discovery and load balancing for multiple API instances
- **Developer Experience**: Create service generator CLI for consistent boilerplate
- **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed requests
